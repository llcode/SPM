# Software Process and Management project

## Introduction

This repositoty is a java ssh project for Software Process and Management class.

## How to use

In fact I never use github in a team. This time I want to give it a try. Surely, we will meet difficulties and make mistakes while using, but I think it worth the effort. 

Later we will use the Issues and Wiki function, so everyone should visit github  or check your email frequently.

Documents will be placed in "Doc" directory. Related projects will be placed in "PastProjects" in case we forgot how to write programs.
